This is a project of Sharing Bike demand Prediction

Final reports and code can be viewed in the reports and src folder.

Sharing bike brings much more convenience for people’s life, and this also serves as a complement for the public transportation to ease the traffic. However, the demand for the sharing bike varies from time to time, if there are more sharing bikes on the street, it will not only increase the operation cost for the company but also have a reverse effect on easing the traffic pressure, which will block the road sometimes because the overwhelming amount of bikes. Therefore, it is essential to make a prediction about the demand for the sharing bike from time to time, which will lower the company’s cost an also increase the efficiency.

This project takes data from UCI Machine Learning Repository

The target variable is the number of bikes per hour. It aims to give an prediction of how many bikes should be used in the next hour and different regression model and ensemble models are used.
